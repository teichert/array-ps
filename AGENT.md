Outputs:
- High quality testing library for postscript

Rules:
- Use the principles of tdd. (only add a single test at a time; make it fail; then ask me if you should continue; then add the minimum code to make it pass; then refactor 
and make sure that everything still passes; then repeat)
- Test names should be complete sentences
